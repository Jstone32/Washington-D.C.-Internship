# Washington-D.C.-Internship
IT Project Coordinator and web developer. 

Technologies
What software technologies did I apply. Give the technology and its basic use within the project.

## WordPress (CMS):
I used to create calendars, forms, image sliders, headers, banners, footers etc. – to display the content and features on webpages. Also I used it to edit, publish, organize and delete content as needed, whenever the client wanted to change something on the site. 

## FileZilla (FTP): 
I used to back up the webpages before I made any major changes to the webpage.
Mantis: I was in charge of maintaining team members’ updates on a program called Mantis. This program was used constantly to record the work status of clients’ requests. 

Wunderlist: I used this to help stay on top of many tasks at once. 

Skype: This helped due to some team members having a 12 hour time difference; and they could respond to my question whenever they got back online.

Google docs: This is where I kept all of my notes and training agendas used to train clients. This was extremely helpful because it allowed me to share my documents with other applicable individuals. It made my job faster and easier.

Google Voice:  This was nice, because I only had to call my boss using one number, instead of having two work phone numbers or her cell phone.

How I got the Internship
I went to internships.com and created a profile. Then I looked for paid internships in the D.C. area having to do with Computer Science. About a week later I was contacted through internships.com by the CEO of Xykon. Her name is Sumati, she and another man interviewed me over the phone. I started immediately the following Monday.  

What did I learn?
1.	I learned how to create webpages using a CMS. (I already knew how to create webpages manualy using HTML, JavaScribt, and CSS...etc.)
2.	I learned management skills, such as learning how to balance a lot of tasks, as I was the IT Project Coordinator.
3.	How to formally communicate with clients of all types, especially learned email etiquette.
4.	How to work for a boss who has high expectations.
5.	How to work with a team, while integrating Mantis. 
6.	Specific skills and knowledge learned during the internship. These can include new technologies, software development techniques, background on the specific business, general work practices etc. 

Preparation 
1.	What classes / topics / experience prepared me to succeed?
2.	 Second … etc. Mention specific classes or professors if you want

Two classes that really prepared me to succeed was
1.	CS2610 Developing Dynamic, Database-driven, Web Applications of Computer Science really prepared me to succeed by teaching me about FTP and databases.
2.	CS 1030 Foundations prepared me by teaching me CSS, HTML5 and JavaScript.
3.	 Linda Duhadway taught both of these classes and she makes sure she teaches you every detail and is very thorough, so you NEVER have to go home and use google to explain what was just taught. 
4.	Going to career fairs and having a few interviews helped me prepare for the interview that got me this job. 

### Company Description 
At Xykon they provide support in the areas of web development, system integration, hardware installations (office setups, electrical, telecommunications, AV) and risk management. They make money mostly by creating websites and maintaining them for various clients. There are 7 employees. This is not a public company so it’s not on the stock market. The only location is in Washington D.C. a few buildings down from the white house.

## Internship Objective 
I was hired to be the IT Project Coordinator. I was the middle man between the clients and the developers making sure things got done on a timely manner. Also I would step in and help out the developers back up the websites or change/fix the way they content was displayed on the websites. 

## My role in the team
How did you fit in with the organization? Did you work in a team? How did you interact with other members? (meetings, software development methods, presentations required, communication tools etc).
I made sure the team worked smoothly and cohesively. I did work on a team of 3 people for each project. Because most members lived in different countries, I would most often use Skype, email, or Google Hangouts to interact with them.  We also used Mantis to keep each other up to date on our projects progress. 

## Projects
Overall description of the projects (as a list is fine). Make sure you describe the problem that you solved.
Must have at least two figures here. You are not allowed to give just text!
Be careful not to give any details that could be intellectual property of the company! If there are any concerns, then generalize the description to remove specific information.

I helped create the new Vasculitis Foundation website https://www.vasculitisfoundation.org/ and the global communities website http://www.globalcommunities.org/  I was in constant communication with international coworkers. My main “problem that I solved” every day was making sure that us as web developers knew what the client wanted; and getting the result done in a timely manner. 
Here are some examples of what I did: 
This is an old website that I helped change…
 
 
..into this new updated website 
This new website is up to date, more interactive, and easier to read. One problem that I had to solve was a calendar issue; it was not displaying future events on the calendar.



Figures that illustrate the problem and
solutions. Pick figures that show the reader
the big picture. Remember people may only 
spend a few minutes on the poster.
What is the take away message about what
you did?
